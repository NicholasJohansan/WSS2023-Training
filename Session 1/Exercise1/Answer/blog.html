  <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
  <p>posted by BGB, November 15, 2012</p>

  <p>
    This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <em>sous vide</em>. In <em>sous vide</em>
    cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set
    to the target temperature of the food. In his book, <b><em>Cooking for Geeks</em></b>, Jeff Potter describes it as
    "ultra-low-temperature poaching".
  </p>

  <p>
    Next month, we will be serving <strong>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</strong>. To reserve a seat at the
    chef table, contact us before November 30.
  </p>

  <p>Location: Baker's Corner, Seekonk, MA</p>
  <p>Hours: Tuesday to Saturday, 11am to midnight</p>
